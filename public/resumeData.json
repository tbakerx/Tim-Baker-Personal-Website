    "bio": "I am an athlete at heart, with an entrepreneurial spirit, a knack for online security, and a passion for coding. Born in a small town in Northern BC, I made my move to Victoria where I work as a full stack developer for Instant Domain Search, alongside my many ongoing projects. I love to create and tend to keep a few too many projects on the go at a time. Outside of work I am an avid motorcyclist, soccer player and Muay Thai fighter. I love to travel and lead a fairly nomadic lifestyle. I built much of my early portfolio from beaches of Southeast Asia and dream of being able to take my work with me while travelling the world.",

It was here that I discovered my passion for scalable application programming (web and mobile), the security behind computer and application systems, and found that I have a knack for understanding complex algorithms."

While here, I studied Computer Systems Technology, a 2 year lead-in to a Bachelors of Computer Science. This was a very hands-on experience focused more on building projects than general theory. Here I built database structures for fictional companies, created small video games, hand-coded Space Invaders from scratch in Assembly Language, built and coded an Arduino Robot to navigate obstacle courses, a lot of Java and C++ programming for data structures, and much more."

I was brought on as an early hire here to help take an application that had seen enormous and steady organic growth and give it the boost it deserved. \n\nAs a member of a very small but talented team, I work across the gamut of our stack. This currently consists of a React/Typescript frontend (recently migrated to Next.js), a new combination of Golang and Rust Servers, and an iOS app (soon to be React Native)."

As well, I led the development of V2 of our mobile application written in React Native. I have worked extensively with React/Redux as well as with react hooks. \n\nMore recently, I have been given the opportunity to lead our cybersecurity initiative. As part of our partnership with a number of 3rd parties and our planned expansion into Europe, the need to tighten security and bring our technology up to certain compliance standards has become evident. It is my job to bring us into alignment with these, as well as hardening our security stance as a whole."

During my time here I have worked in all roles involved in the Water and Sewer Department, with the exception of equipment operating. I worked as a water meter technician programming the meters in people's homes. I worked in location, excavation, installation and repair of water and sewer lines. I learned how to install, dismantle, troubleshoot, and repair the most popular models of fire hydrants. \n\nWhile working for the Water Treatment and Distribution Department, and alongside one partner, we led the first Uni-Directional Flow program our city has done in years. This requires a thorough understanding of the city's water grid to selectively force excessive pressure through a water line in order to clean it. This must be done in a specific order for every line in the city.   "
